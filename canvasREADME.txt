 9.14 Project Phase 1

Read the Project Phase 1 PDF document posted on BBLearn for the details of this phase of the project and the requirements. Submit and test your code for this phase, and get instant feedback and score, in this Lab below.

IMPORTANT (READ VERY CAREFULLY):

    The total number of submissions you can make is limited to 20. Be very careful before submitting your code for evaluation. Test your code thoroughly using the examples below in "Develop" mode, make sure it's correct and free of errors / bugs, before submitting it.
    You are highly recommended to regularly save your code for this project phase (from the editor below) to a local file on your computer, for two reasons: 1) to avoid losing your work on zyBook unexpectedly; 2) to be able to reuse your code in the later phases of the project. It is your responsibility to protect your work from being lost; in almost all cases, losing your work is not a valid reason for an extension, a make-up assignment, extra credits, etc.
    This Lab will be hidden one day after its due date, so make sure that you copy and save your submitted answer (code) to your computer within this time window to be able to reuse it later.

The following examples are explained in the project phase PDF document posted on BBLearn. Refer to the document for details.

Example 1: If the input is

0.05 0 0 0
1.0 0.1
1.5 0.2
1.2 0
0.8 -0.1
0.9 0.1
1.2 0.15

then the output is

0.2500: 0.2700, 0.0028, 0.0150
0.3000: 0.3300, 0.0040, 0.0225
